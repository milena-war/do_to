The selected code is a script for managing a to-do list using a SQLite database. 
The script imports the sqlite3 module and uses the sys module to access command-line arguments.

The setup function creates a new SQLite database called todo.db and creates a table
called todos with three columns: todo_id, title, and is_done. 
The function checks if the script was called with the argument setup, 
and if so, it executes the SQL query to create the table.

The script then opens the todo.db database and creates a cursor to execute SQL queries. 
It queries the todos table and prints all the rows where is_done is 0 (not done).

The script then prints a menu with two options: add a new todo item or mark an item as completed.
The script prompts the user to choose an option and processes the input based on the selected option.

If the user selects to add a new todo item, the script prompts the user to enter
the todo item title and inserts a new row into the todos table with the title.

If the user selects to mark an item as completed, the script prompts the user 
to enter the todo item ID and updates the is_done column to 1 for the corresponding row.

Finally, the script closes the database connection.
